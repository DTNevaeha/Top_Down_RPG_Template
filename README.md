## Game Overview

This RPG starter pack contains assets for the following

- **Player**: You can walk around and throw projectiles with animations
  
- **Enemy**: There is an enemy sprite with animations, does not do more
  
- **Projectile**: You can throw an animated projectile
  
- **MAP**: A default map has been setup and fully customizable with sprite sheet
  
- **Graphics**: Graphics have been provided and initialized
  
- **Camera**: The camera automatically follows the player around the map

- **Mouse Over**: When putting the mouse over text, it will change colors

## How to Play

1. **Start**: To start the game, mouse over and select Start Game
   
2. **Movement**: Walk around with WASD

3. **Attack**: Press the space bar to shoot projectiles

4. **QUIT**: Either click quit game at the main menu or click the X

## Whats Not Included

- **Collision**: There is currently only collision setup for the default map size so the player cannot leave the island border, this does not work if the map size changes.

- **Fighting**: The enemy currently does nothing, victory, or losing scenario

- **End projectiles**: The projectiles will continue on forever, never
                        disappearing or being removed

- **Victory/End**: There is no current victory scenario or way to lose

- **Items**: No items or item menu is included

- **Other**: As there is no real way for me to list everything that is common
            in an RPG, I have only listed the main things that are currently
            missing from this that others may want included. Other details may
            also be missing, but may be added in the future
